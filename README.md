My final project for my senior undergraduate project. This is a study in afrofuturism as a sort of personal and systematic salvation for afropessimism, through the lens of video games and the medium of fashion. I've taking large inspiration from Audre Lorde's poems and other texts and from my own life. So far, I've chosen to focus on character design by designing 4 narratives people would be able to follow in the game, similar to choose your own adventure.

To engage my audience with my designs, I've chosen to create a quiz of sorts. It will lead people to which narrative may engage them most, plus other information about the inspiration for the player character's particular design, and suggested readings if they'd like to learn more.

I used the p5.js library to create the quiz, and HTML with a free Bootstrap theme (which I've downloaded into the "Website Templates" folder) to create the website. Find the Bootstrap theme I used here: https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-creative/
